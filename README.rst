django-storages-s3upload
========================

This project is under development, as in its current state is far from finished.


The goals of this Django app are to:

* Create signed forms for posting files directly in to Amazon S3 buckets.
* Provide callback views/urls and/or signals so that it is possible to listen
  for when files have been successfully uploaded.
* Provide an extended form class which uses dropzone.js for handling multiple
  uploads with thumbnails and progress bars.
